## Why do I want this?

As you probably know, there are numerous boilerplates available for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), so you might be wondering why you would want to use ours. Most of the boilerplate projects come with a lot of code that you rarely need. Our boilerplate was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and provides you with a great starting point for any React project with as few lines of code as possible, especially if you want to use [Flowtype](https://flowtype.org/).

## What do I need to get started?

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 6 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## What's in the box?

- [Flowtype](https://flowtype.org/) Type checker
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) User interface components
- [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) Application Architecture For Building User Interfaces
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) Utility library
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) JavaScript transpiler
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) JavaScript Linter
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) Code formatter
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) CSS transformer
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) CSS Linter
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) Module bundler
